Errands are tasks which are executed after a tile installation/update (Post-Deploy Errands) or before a tile gets deleted (Pre-Delete Errands). 
The a9s BOSH for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile provides two errands that can be disabled in the **Errands** panes of the tile configuration:

##<a id='cloud-config-updater'></a> Run Cloud Config Updater Errand

The Cloud Config Updater errand uploads the Cloud Config YAML specified in the **Cloud Config** tab. 
If you deactivate this errand, changes in the **Cloud Config** pane have no effect.

If this errand is never executed with a proper Cloud Config, the a9s service tiles are not able to provision service instances.

##<a id='bosh-configurator'></a> Run BOSH Configurator Errand

The BOSH configurator errand uploads the required stemcells to the a9s BOSH director.

##<a id='bosh-cleaner'></a> Run BOSH Cleaner Errand

When the a9s BOSH for PCF tile is uninstalled, this errands takes care that no deployment, orphaned disk, or any other artefact remains.
