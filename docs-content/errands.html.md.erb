Errands are tasks which are executed after a tile installation/update (Post-Deploy Errands) or bevore a tile gets deleted (Pre-Delete Errands). The a9s BOSH for PCF tile provides two errands which can be disabled in the "errands" sections of the tile configuration:

##<a id='cloud-config-updater'></a> Run Cloud Config Updater Errand

The Cloud Config Updater errand uploads the Cloud Config YAML you've specified in the "Cloud Config" tab of the a9s BOSH for PCF tile to the a9s BOSH director. In case you deactivate this errands, changes in the "Cloud Config" tab would not have any effects anymore.

If this errand is never executed with a proper Cloud Config the a9s service tiles won't be able to provision service instances.

##<a id='errands'></a> Run BOSH configurator Errand

The BOSH configurator errand uploads the required stemcells to the a9s BOSH director.
